# Functionalsis

This file contains some notes and code I compiled while learning about functional programming and the Elixir programming language. It is mostly a documentation of my learning progress and and a tracker of what concepts I've studied so far.

This repository should NOT be used as study material if you're also new to functional programming/Elixir, however I did keep my notes as clear and consise as possible for future reference in case anyone wants to check them out.

To access the notes and explanations, head to [notes.md](https://github.com/myrmlbst/functionalsis/blob/main/notes.md).
